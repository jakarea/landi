Task: Redesign Student Panel (Blade Files Only)

Reference Design

Use the Instructor Panel design (available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/AI-for-Advertising-Bootcamp-25) only as a design guideline.

Match color palette, background style, spacing, padding, and margins with the instructor panel.

Framework & Style

Convert the existing Bootstrap-based design into Tailwind CSS.

Design similar to the instructor panel but Apply a modern, trending, and futuristic design approach for genZ student like. Make learning fun and enteractive design

Default theme: Dark mode, but also design with light mode compatibility.

Design Features

Add smooth hover effects (e.g., ray-like movement across borders and buttons).

Every delete button must trigger a confirmation prompt before action.

Keep all existing backend logic intact â€“ only edit Blade view files.

Scope

Apply redesign to all student panel Blade files.

After completing each Blade file (linked in sequence), report back so we can move to the next link.
